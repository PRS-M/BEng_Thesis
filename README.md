## General Info
A part of diploma thesis focused on automotive simulation and design.
System combining magnetorheological dampers and air suspension.
Not great, ~not terrible~ rather terrible in terms of code.
Though, the code itself was not the main focus at the time.

## Technologies
* C++
* Arduino

## Features
1. Arduino board utilising data collected from accelerometer and rangefinder.
2. LCD Display showing real-time values and current setup.
3. LEDs showing suspension modes.
4. Console app retreiving and parsing data from *.txt files  
(AMESim Simulation outcome simulating actual driving conditions - road texture etc.).
5. USB serial communication of the console app with Arduino Board simulating actual driving conditions.
6. LCD screen showing values (air pressure) in 4 air springs and stiffnes of the MR Dampers.
